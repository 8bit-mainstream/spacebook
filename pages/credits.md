Spacebook was inspired by my search for the simplest possible way to spin up a modern website in the least amount of time, with the freedom to extend as needed, zero cost, no maintenance burden, and virtually zero effort. 

Eleventy was a perfect fit, and I spent many hours researching these and other starter projects for ideas and inspiration: 

* [Eleventy Netlify Boilerplate](https://github.com/danurbanowicz/eleventy-netlify-boilerplate) by Dan Urbanowiczi -- I used this as the basis for Netlify CMS integration and for overall code structure
* [Eleventy-Tailwind-AlpineJS Starter](https://github.com/gregwolanski/eleventy-tailwindcss-alpinejs-starter) by Greg Wolanski -- this was the method I followed for integrating Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js
* [Eleventy Base Blog](https://github.com/philhawksworth/eleventyone) by Zach Leatherman and the Eleventy team -- I used this as an "official" reference even though spacebooks do not contain blog functionality
* [Staticrypt implementation](https://gist.github.com/epicfaace/c1a4452401af14d35b60fe211f2c1559) by various, including this Gist linked from the Staticrypt issue queue
* [Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra) by Shu Ding -- this is a Next.js project that also uses Tailwind and heavily inspired the overall design of spacebook. 
* [Add Search to an Eleventy website with Elasticlunr](https://www.belter.io/eleventy-search/) by Duncan McDougall -- this gave me the basics for integrating Elasticlunr

Overall I investigated and researched more than a dozen additional [Eleventy starter projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) for inspiration, code snippets, and to learn more about how Eleventy works. Thanks to all -- there is no one "right way" to build an Eleventy site and this is just one small attempt.
