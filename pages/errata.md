This is a small page to track known errors, todos, and other small things I wish worked differently. 

## Errata 

* [ ] **package-lock.json** Like similar starter projects I've seen, this one did not ship with a lock file. But midway through development, a new release of a PurgeCSS dependency started breaking builds. The project is currently locked to a working version in package-lock.json. I'd like to soon update and/or re-remove package-lock.json. In the meantime, update modules at your own risk!
* [ ] **Pretty code** As it turns out I've come to rely on Prettier to format all of my code. There is not a Prettier plugin for Nunjuck templates, and some code is in need of, well, prettying up. 
* [ ]  **FOUC** I've got it working pretty smoothly now, but there is still sometimes a small Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC) that appears when a site is encrypted (usually on first page load only) that I'd like to fix  
* [ ] **Mobile footer** On Android mobile (and maybe iPhone?) the fixed footer does not stay "fixed" until you first get to the bottom of the page. This may be a default but I'd prefer a fixed footer on all screens.

## To-dos

* [ ] **Eleventy Images** I'd like to integrate this plugin for more advanced image handling (currently the burden is on you to serve the best/smallest image you can)
* [ ] **Streamlined starter content** Currently when you install spacebook, you get ALL of the content as it currently exists on spacebook.app. It only takes a hot minute to delete all of these pages, but it may be better to ship with a smaller set of starter content.
