By default, spacebook sites are set up so they will NOT get indexed by Google or other search engines or send referrer links to outside sites. (You can change this if wish.) There are no ad trackers, tracking cookies, or other nonsense installed. 

## Level one: Security through obscurity

By default, your site is hidden from search engines and won't send referrer links but it is not truly secure. Anybody who discovers the link will be able to view the site. You can use an obscured Netlify site URL for added protection against accidental discovery. This is the default setting and safe for many use cases. 

## Level two: Encryption

If you wish to you put your site behind a password, you can do so by following the [password protection](/encryption) instructions. This will encrypt all of your files, and require all users to enter a password before viewing. 

## Level three: Basic authentication

 You can upgrade your Netlify account for basic site wide authentication if necessary. It is similar to the level two encryption but is less rough around the edges, it does not use encryption, and there is no page slow down once you have authenticated. It will cost you $20 a month or thereabouts.


## Make your site searchable!

::: callout
If you want to open up your site to Google and other search engines, simply remove the **robots.txt** file from the root of your project. 
:::

## Remove noreferrer and/or nofollow attributes!

::: callout 
Edit the **mdIterator** plugin settings in your .eleventy.js configuration file to change these settings for external links.

## Don't forget Github!

::: alert 
If privacy is a top priority don't forget to set your Github repository to private also!
